## Usage

## Credits

While I may have had some help from multiple sources (as listed below), I can assure you that the work provided is my own, original work.

1. While I had some help from my friend priyaravi, I used the variable names FOR INSPIRATION ONLY. I can safely guarantee you that this project is MY OWN, ORIGINAL WORK.

The link to the help is https://github.com/priyaravi23/react-portfolio

2. I had trouble seeing the site on my local machine. Anthony Maddatu helped me with rebooting the website from the very start. That allowed me to create a brand-new version of the website. Thanks!

3. All colors were made possible by Coolors. The link is https://coolors.co/user/palettes/65d80721e065df000b499083.

4. Can you blame me? I tried using different colors, instead of Bootstrap. Luckily, my friends from PBS KIDS helped me out with that! The PDF is https://pbs-kids-brand.pbskids.org/downloads/pbs-kids-style-guide.pdf.
